## Integrating Plug Connect Package from @Psychedelic using NPM CLI

To integrate the Plug Connect package from @Psychedelic using the NPM CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have**:
   - A personal access token (you can generate one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
   - The personal access token should have the appropriate scopes, including `repo` and `read:packages`, to gain access to the GitHub Package Registry.

2. **Authenticate via npm login**:
   
   ```sh
   npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@Psychedelic

This will prompt you to enter your GitHub username and personal access token.



## üì¶ Create a New Project

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 16` and [`dfx`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) `>= 0.14` are installed on your system.

Run the following commands in a new, empty project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/martin-karani/defilending.git # Download this starter project
dfx start --clean --background # Run dfx in the background
npm run setup # Install packages, deploy canisters, and generate type bindings

npm start # Start the development server
```

When ready, run `dfx deploy --network ic` to deploy your application to the Internet Computer.

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- Customize your project's code style by editing the `.prettierrc` file and then running `npm run format`.
- Reduce the latency of update calls by passing the `--emulator` flag to `dfx start`.
- Install a Motoko package by running `npx ic-mops add <package-name>`. Here is a [list of available packages](https://mops.one/).
- Split your frontend and backend console output by running `npm run frontend` and `npm run backend` in separate terminals.
